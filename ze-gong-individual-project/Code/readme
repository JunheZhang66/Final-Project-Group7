## Training Network 
1. setting up the configuration
   download the file yolov3-custom_train.cfg and move it to cfg folder inside root Darknet derectory
2. navigate to root directory where Darknet framework was installed and type in following command:
   ./darknet detector train cfg/custom_data.data cfg/yolov3-custom_train.cfg backup/yolov3-custom_train_final.weights -dont_show
3. calculate mAP to find the best weight 
   In the same terminal, type in following command for each saved weight, for example, to calculate mAP for weight at iteration 8000
   ./darknet detector map cfg/custom_data.data cfg/yolov3-custom_train.cfg backup/yolov3-custom_train_8000.weights
   After calculation, find calculated mAP at the last lines. The weight that have the biggest mAP is best weight.
