# Final-Project-Group7
### by Hao Heng, Junhe Zhang, Ze Gong

Introduction  
In this project we will: 
● We will download the dataset from Google Open Image dataset with certain categories we      choose to train the model and generate all needed files for training yolov3 model on darknet framework.
● We will use the Darknet frame and pre-trained weight of the yolov3 model to train on our own dataset and evaluate the model.
● At last we will use our model on a video we recorded and a image we took to see the actual performance of the model
