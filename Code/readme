## Data Preprocessing



## Training Network



## Generating Final Result

For processing image:
1. Open process_image_video.py, scroll down to line 130.
2. Set img_dir = absolute path to the image file you want to process
3. Set label = absolute path to the classes.names file you created during data preprocessing (classes.names)
4. Set cfg_dir = absolute path to the network structure file (Example: yolov3-custom_train.cfg)
5. Set weights_dir = absolute path to the best weights file you get during training network (Example: yolov3-custom_train_last.weights)

For processing video:
1. Same process as for image
