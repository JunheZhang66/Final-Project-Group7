## Data Preprocessing
#Download the dataset
1. Go to the directory where you install the OIDv4_ToolKit and run this command in terminal:

'python3 main.py downloader --classes Car Bicycle_wheel Bus Traffic_light Jeans Laptop Person --type_csv train  -- multiclasses 1 --limit 1000'

The '--classes'' specify the category you wanto to use, add underscore if the class has two words. '--limit 1000' specify downloading 1000 instances 
for each category

2. After completing the downloading, (if this is the first time you download), you will see a floder called 'OID'. Inside of it, there are two subdirectory, 
csv_folder, Dataset. Now we need copy 'getting-full-path.py' to the csv_folder directory and run command

'python3 getting-full-path.py' 

It will output the path of the file inside of csv_folder 

3. Then we copy 'getting-full-path.py' to the 'Dataset/train/Car_Bicycle wheel_Bus_Traffic light_Jeans_Laptop_Person' folder where you store your images, and run 

'python3 getting-full-path.py' 

It will output the path of all the images

4. Then we paste the path to 'converting-annotations.py' , 'creating-train-and-test-txt-files.py' , 'creating-files-data-and-name.py'

5. Then run 'converting-annotations.py', 'creating-train-and-test-txt-files.py', 'creating-files-data-and-name.py' in this order
